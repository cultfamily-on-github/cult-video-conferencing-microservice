# CULT Video Conferencing Microservice

CULT Video Conferencing - aka [onlycultfans.org](onlycultfans.org) - gives you the chance to communicate with each other. 

It might allow for 24/7 "consultation-hour" live streams in which some of our CULT playmates answer questions around decentralization, self hosted wallets, deflationary currencies like CULT & RVLT etc. 

In order to strengthen resilience, scalability, composability and technological freedom for contributors, we establish a microservices architecture. 

Everyone is invited to foster the emergence of manifold architectures of freedom by contributing to this repository.


## Frontend
See docs folder. The programming effort was relatively low. 
## Backend
I deployed this via github pages so that I do not need a dedicated own backend for this feature. I wonder if the implementation of [these ideas](https://github.com/cultfamily-on-github/cult-video-conferencing-microservice/issues/2) would be valuable. Feedback is welcome
